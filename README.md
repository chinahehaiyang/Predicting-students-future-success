# Predicting-students-future-success
Beginner program made with Java and Octave as an IA for Compsci IB HL.
This is a program made for my teacher to provide better recommendation of future courses to his ELL students.

***Note that this program only works on windows, and the octave installation path MUST be "C:\Octave\Octave-4.2.1".***
This program is no where to be perfect, but it is my first attempt into making a real-life program. There are many things, such as the path of the octave file MUST be in a path, that could be changed, but my programming level is not there yet (I do not know a way to get around this at the moment)

The reason I used Octave to do the calculations is because I wanted to push out a project very quickly and thus I just chose Octave on top of my head. The machine learning course online, https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning, have sample Octave codes that I can refer to.

Please note that this program is intended to be used by a specific person, my teacher, for his students and thus reading data from excel files was hard coded.
